deploy rails app from github to heroku
To deploy a Rails app from GitHub to Heroku, you will need to perform the following steps:

Create a new app on Heroku, and make note of the app name and URL.
Connect your GitHub repository to the Heroku app by going to the "Deploy" tab in the Heroku app dashboard, and selecting GitHub as the deployment method.
Configure your Rails app to work with Heroku by adding a Gemfile and a Procfile to the root of your repository. The Gemfile should include the pg gem for PostgreSQL, and the Procfile should specify the command to start the app.
Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.
Trigger a deployment from the Heroku app dashboard by selecting the branch you want to deploy and clicking the "Deploy" button.
Once the deployment is complete, you can visit your app at the URL specified in step 1.
Make sure your Gemfile and Procfile are correct, then run the following commands in your terminal:

Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
Then, in the Heroku website, go to your app's deploy tab and connect your github repository.

Once you have connected your Github repo, you can deploy your app.

Copy code
heroku run rake db:migrate
After that, your app will be deployed.
