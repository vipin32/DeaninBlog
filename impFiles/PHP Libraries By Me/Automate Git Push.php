To automate the process of pushing code to a Git repository every time you save a file, you can use a Git hook. Git hooks are scripts that are automatically executed by Git at certain points in the git workflow, such as when you commit or push code.

To set up a hook to push code every time you save a file, you can create a pre-commit hook that checks for changes to your code and pushes them to the repository if any are found.

Here are the steps to set up a pre-commit hook to push code every time you save a file:

In your Git repository, navigate to the .git/hooks directory.

Create a new file called pre-commit in the hooks directory and make it executable using the chmod +x pre-commit command.

Open the pre-commit file in a text editor and add the following code:

Copy code
#!/bin/sh

# Check for changes to the code
if git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
    # No changes were detected, so exit
    exit 0
else
    # Changes were detected, so push the code
    git push
fi
This code checks for changes to the code using the git diff-index command and exits if no changes are found. If changes are detected, it pushes the code to the repository using the git push command.

Save the pre-commit file and close it.
Now, every time you save a file in your repository, the pre-commit hook will be triggered and will check for changes to the code. If any changes are found, it will push the code to the repository.

Note: This will push all changes to the repository, not just the changes made in the file you saved. If you only want to push specific changes, you will need to modify the hook to stage and commit those changes before pushing them to the repository.
