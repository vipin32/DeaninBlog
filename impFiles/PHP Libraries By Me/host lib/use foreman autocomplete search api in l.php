use foreman autocomplete search api in laravel

To use the Foreman autocomplete search API in Laravel, you can use the sendRequest() method of the Foreman API client to send a GET request to the API, and use the response() helper function to handle the response.

Here is an example of how you might do this:

Copy code
$manager = new ForemanApiManager();

$response = $manager->sendRequest('GET', 'search/auto_complete_search', [
  'query' => [
    'term' => $search,
  ],
]);

$results = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents());

This code sends a GET request to the search/auto_complete_search endpoint of the Foreman API, passing the search term as a query parameter. It then decodes the JSON response from the API and stores it in the $results variable.

You can modify the code to handle any errors that may occur while making the request, or to specify additional query parameters or options. Consult the Foreman API documentation for more information on the available parameters and options for the autocomplete search API.

To display the search results to the user, you can use a view and pass the results to the view using the with() method. You can then use Blade syntax to display the results.

Here is an example of how you might do this:

Copy code
return view('search.results')->with(['results' => $results]);

In the view, you can use the $results variable to display the search results. You can use a loop to iterate over the results and display each one, or you can use a JavaScript library to handle the search and display the results in real-time as the user types.

what is ForemanApiManager above
In the code examples provided above, ForemanApiManager is a fictional class that represents an API client for the Foreman system. It is not a built-in class in Laravel or Foreman, but rather a custom class that you would need to create in order to use the Foreman API in your Laravel application.

You can create this class by defining a new PHP class and adding methods for each of the API endpoints you want to use. These methods should use the sendRequest() method to send HTTP requests to the API and handle the responses.

Here is an example of what the ForemanApiManager class might look like:

Copy code
class ForemanApiManager
{
  private $baseUrl;
  private $apiKey;

  public function __construct($baseUrl, $apiKey)
  {
    $this->baseUrl = $baseUrl;
    $this->apiKey = $apiKey;
  }

  public function sendRequest($method, $endpoint, $options = [])
  {
    $client = new Client([
      'base_uri' => $this->baseUrl,
      'headers' => [
        'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        'Authorization' => "Bearer $this->apiKey",
      ],
    ]);

    return $client->request($method, $endpoint, $options);
  }
}

This class has a constructor that takes the base URL and API key for the Foreman API as arguments, and stores them in instance variables. It also has a sendRequest() method that takes a HTTP method, endpoint, and optional request options as arguments, and uses the Guzzle HTTP client to send a request to the API.

You can then use this class in your Laravel application to make API requests to Foreman. For example:

Copy code
$manager = new ForemanApiManager($baseUrl, $apiKey);

$response = $manager->sendRequest('GET', 'vms');

$vms = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents());

This code creates a new instance of the ForemanApiManager class, passing the base URL and API key
