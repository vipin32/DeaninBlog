To manage multiple hypervisors using PHP, you can create a library that abstracts the differences between the various hypervisors and provides a common interface for performing common tasks.

Here is an example of how such a library might be implemented:

Copy code
<?php

class HypervisorManager
{
  private $client;

  public function __construct($type, $url, $username, $password)
  {
    switch ($type) {
      case 'vmware':
        $this->client = new Vmware\VSphere\Client($url);
        break;
      case 'hyperv':
        $this->client = new HyperV\Client($url);
        break;
      case 'virtualbox':
        $this->client = new VirtualBox\Client($url);
        break;
      default:
        throw new Exception('Unsupported hypervisor type');
    }

    $auth = new stdClass();
    $auth->username = $username;
    $auth->password = $password;
    $this->client->login($auth);
  }

  public function getVmList()
  {
    return $this->client->findAllObjects('VirtualMachine');
  }

  public function createVm($name, $template)
  {
    $this->client->createVm($name, $template);
  }

  public function startVm($name)
  {
    $this->client->startVm($name);
  }

  public function stopVm($name)
  {
    $this->client->stopVm($name);
  }

  public function deleteVm($name)
  {
    $this->client->deleteVm($name);
  }

  public function __destruct()
  {
    $this->client->logout();
  }
}

This library provides a common interface for performing tasks such as querying the list of virtual machines, creating virtual machines, starting and stopping virtual machines, and deleting virtual machines. The specific implementation of these tasks will depend on the type of hypervisor being used.

To use this library, you can instantiate an object of the HypervisorManager class, passing in the type of hypervisor, the URL of the hypervisor, and the credentials to use for authentication. You can then call the various methods of the HypervisorManager class to perform tasks on the hypervisor.

Copy code
$manager = new HypervisorManager('vmware', 'https://my-hypervisor.example.com/sdk', 'username', 'password');

$vmList = $manager->getVmList();
foreach ($vmList as $vm) {
  echo $vm->name . "\n";
}

$manager->createVm('My VM', 'CentOS 7');
$manager->startVm('My VM');

$manager->stopVm('My VM');
$manager->deleteVm('My VM');
